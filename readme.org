* Pequito Lito
  /a small litophany generator/

  To make litophanies with a 3D printer.
  
  In essencese it converts an image to a heightmap. Where the heights
  are inverted. Tall mountains correpsonds to dark regions and
  vallys to light areas.

  The output is obj as it is easy to generate and most slices will read it.

  It assumes that the slicer uses mm as measument units.

  The heightmap comes with a userconfigurable box underneath such that
  the heightmap is a solid.

  It uses python, Pillow and docopt.
